## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: High-Impact Pages (Focus on Texas)
1. **Specialties → Industries Mapping:**
   - Map competitor's `/specialties/*` URLs to our `/industries/*` structure
   - Add 20-25 industry-specific pages with Texas focus
   
2. **Service Pages:**
   - Add 10-15 most important services (FBA prep, returns, drop shipping, etc.)

3. **Location Pages:**
   - Focus ONLY on Texas cities (not all 146 US/Canada/UK locations)
   - Add 10-15 more Texas cities: Corpus Christi, Brownsville, Amarillo, Lubbock, etc.

4. **Reviews:**
   - Add 15-20 more 3PL company reviews

### Priority 2: Resource Downloads
- Add 10-12 missing downloadable tools/templates

### Priority 3: Vendor Portal Sub-Pages
- Add 4 vendor resource pages

### Priority 4: Nice-to-Have
- News/blog section
- Partnership pages
- Editorial guidelines

## NEXT STEPS

**Question for you:** Since we're building **3PLTexas.net** (Texas-focused), should we:

1. **Stay Texas-only** and skip non-Texas locations? (Recommended)
2. **Add specialties** as industry pages or keep separate?
3. **Focus on reviews** of Texas-based 3PLs or national providers?
4. **Prioritize services** that are most relevant to Texas market?

Let me know your priorities and I can start building the missing pages!
